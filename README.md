I’m a polymath with over 10 years of experience in technology, design, and strategy.

Delayed or disputed payments are common in freelance markets due to a lack of trust between clients and freelancers.

- **Decentralized Reputation System:** <br/>
Current platforms can manipulate reviews or ratings, creating an unfair marketplace.

Automates payments and milestone releases, ensuring freelancers get paid on time and disputes are minimized.
